### CIS 657(01) (Spring/Summer 2024)
### Zachary Stout
### Date Completed: 6/15/2024

#### Used:
- Expo Camera
- Firebase for the database
- React-Native Firebase Analtyics
- EAS Update / Build
- intended to use Google's ML Kit barcode scanning API... failed to get to this.

- deployed build https://expo.dev/preview/update?message=deploy&updateRuntimeVersion=1.0.0&createdAt=2024-06-15T05%3A41%3A15.761Z&slug=hw3-start-template&projectId=92c9fca8-ba71-4c1a-ab2d-ab54bf3fade8&group=bad1d4ec-b96b-4ddb-a952-175a2e8dc0b1

### Notes:
- removed the getHistoryItem database call from the ViewItemScreen, despite this potentially returning a more up-to-date item. This was to preserve more mobile data.
- continued building on since HW3; did not realize the name was still here somehow
